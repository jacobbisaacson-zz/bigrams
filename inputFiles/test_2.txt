build me a daughter lord, who will be strong enough to know when she is weak, and brave enough to face herself when she is afraid.

one who will be proud and unbending in defeat yet humble and gentle in victory.

a daughter whose wishbone will not be where her backbone should be.

a daughter who will know, that to know herself, is the foundation stone of all true knowledge.

rear her I pray, not in the paths of ease and comfort, but under the stress and spur of difficulties and challenges.

here, let her learn to stand up in the storm.  here, let her learn compassion for those who fail.

build me a daughter whose heart will be clean, whose goal will be high.  a daughter who will master herself before she seeks to master others.  one who will learn to laugh yet never forget how to weep.  one who will reach into the future, yet never forget the past.

and, after all these are hers, add I pray, enough of a sense of humor, so that she may always be serious, but not take herself too seriously.  a touch of humility, so that she may always remember the simplicity of true greatness, the open-mind of true wisdom, the meekness of true strength.

then I, her father, will dare into the recesses of my own heart to whisper, "I have not lived in vein."
